1.  function1 is a generator function in JavaScript, typically used in Redux-Saga to handle side effects in a Redux application. 
    This function initiates an HTTP POST request to a specified URL using the action.payload as the request body. It utilizes an 
    AbortController to potentially cancel the request. Upon successfully completing the request, it dispatches an action to 
    update the state through a reducer (indicated by /** reducer 1 */). If an error occurs during the request and the error 
    contains a response (e.response), it dispatches another action to handle the error state via a different reducer (/** reducer
    2 */). Finally, if the request was aborted, it dispatches yet another action to handle the aborted state (/** reducer 3 */).

2.  Yes, it's possible to stop what function1 is doing. The AbortController used in function1 is controlled externally by function2, 
    which calls ctrl.abort(). This aborts the HTTP request being handled in function1. When the abort() method is invoked, the fetch 
    request associated with the ctrl.signal is cancelled, and if this happens, the catch block in function1 captures this as an abort
    exception. The finally block checks if the request was aborted (ctrl.signal.aborted) and then performs the respective cleanup or 
    state update.

3.  a. Scope of ctrl: Currently, ctrl is defined globally, which can lead to issues if multiple instances of function1 are running 
      simultaneously, as they would share the same AbortController. This should be scoped locally within each instance of function1 
      to ensure that abort signals are managed on a per-instance basis. if you don't mind please read my medium blog ![link](https://medium.com/@LeeLuciano/%E9%9D%A2%E8%A9%A6%E5%8F%8D%E6%89%8B%E6%8B%8D-closure-979177721a76)

    b. Error Handling: The error handling can be expanded to better differentiate between types of errors (network errors, aborts, 
      HTTP errors). Using more specific checks or error types might provide better management and reaction to different conditions.
      Can check those grate third party library ex: rtk-query, tanstack-query(react-query).
    c. Config Object Enhancements: It's possible to refactor the config object setup or externalize it into a utility function if 
      similar requests are made elsewhere in the application. This can reduce redundancy and improve code manageability.

    d. I still prefer rxjs solution. The observer will give you pull-base system & push-base system to check the data. If you didn't
      like object-oriented way then you could check [this article](https://dev.to/ryansolid/building-a-reactive-library-from-scratch-1i0p)
      This is why the signal will be so pop in front end dev community.
